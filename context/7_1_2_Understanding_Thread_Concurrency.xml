        - The property of executing multiple threads and processes at the same time is referred to as concurrency
        - when only one cpu, only one thread is running at a given time
        - for multi core cpu systems there are more and more threads.
        - Thread scheduler comes into play.
        - It gives some cpu cycles for each thread to run
        - when a threads alloted time is finished but its task is not finished yet a contect switch occurs: storing current state of thread. And later restore its state
        - thread priority - numeric value

        Thread.MIN_PRIORITY      1
        Thread.NORM_PRIORITY     5
        Thread.MAX_PRIORITY      10
