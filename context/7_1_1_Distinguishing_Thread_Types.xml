        - All java applications are all multi-threaded, even hello - world !
        - A System thread
            - is created by the JVM and runs in the background of application. For ex: Garbage collector
            - when encounters a problem can't recover and generates java error instead of exception. (for ex: run out of memory)
        - A user-defined thread
            - created by app developer to accomplish a specific task
        - we can consider applications as single threaded when there is only one user-defined thread. So we may omit system threads.
