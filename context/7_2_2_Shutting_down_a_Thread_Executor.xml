        It is important to call shutdown method
        A thread executor returns a non-deamon thread. So if we do not shutdown than our app will never terminate
        When we call shutdown method:
        - firstly executor will not accept any new tasks
        - it will complete ongoing/previously submitted tasks.
        - In this case isShutdown method will return true but isTerminated will return false
        - If a new task is submitted in this case: a RejectedExecutionException will be thrown
        - when all tasks are done, the executor will terminage and both methods above will return true

        shutdown method does not actually stop any tasks which are already submitted to the executor.
        For this reason there is shutdownNow method. It tries to attempts running tasks and ignores already submitted ones
        It returns a List&lt;Runnable&gt; including tasks that are not executed
